# VanBurenLauncher
A Launcher and settings editor for Fallout Van Buren
* Get the latest (non-release) version [here](github.com/kran27/VanBurenLauncher/raw/main/VBLauncher/bin/Debug/VBLauncher.exe)
* Put the .exe in the game directory
* Some of this stuff can be done with console commands
* A lot of this code is really, really stupid, I am fully aware.
